# Battle of Bands - Console Game

## Description

**Battle of Bands** is a console game developed in Java, where two bands of criminals face off in a fight to the death. Each band consists of a group of soldiers with special abilities, such as **Snipers** and **Rocket Launchers**, who interact and attack each other during a series of rounds. The goal of the game is to annihilate the rival band using the soldiers' unique abilities.

  This project was developed as a tool to practice and reinforce key programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and game logic in Java. All variable names and comments are in Spanish.

## Objectives

The main objective of this program is to practice and review essential programming concepts such as:

- Use of classes and objects.
- Data structures (arrays, object lists).
- Inheritance and polymorphism.
- Random number generation and decision-making based on randomness.
- Control flow (loops and conditionals).
- Console-based user interaction.

## Gameplay

The game is played in the **console**. In each round, the two bands attack each other's soldiers. The attacks are randomized, taking into account the special abilities of each soldier. The simulation continues until one of the bands is entirely eliminated.

### Main Features:

- **Band of Soldiers:** Each band is made up of a set of soldiers, which can either be **Snipers** or **Rocket Launchers**. Soldiers have attributes such as health, position, and attack power.
- **Combat:** During the game, each band gets a chance to attack the other. Damage is calculated based on the soldier's type and the positions of the opposing soldiers.
- **Victory Conditions:** The game ends when one team loses all its soldiers. The winner is the band with any remaining soldiers.

## Additional Features

- **Custom Attacks:** Soldiers attack based on their type (Sniper or Rocket Launcher) and the enemy soldier positions.
- **ASCII Art:** The program includes ASCII art representations for illustrating the moment of victory or defeat for a band.
